# New task preparation

## Classwork task preparation
Complete the steps listed in the "[Prepare to work on today's Classwork](https://debugacademy.com/assignment/3307)" task. This will automatically commit any work in progress to a new branch and automatically prepare your local development environment for the next task.

## Non-classwork task preparation
First, complete all steps listed in "[How to start a new task](https://debugacademy.com/task/drpl3mo-59)" . This will reset your local development website to a clean starting point.

# Overview

### Test our work

For testing, place the View Block using the Layout Builder

*   Content > Add Content > Basic Page
    *   For the Page's Title, add "Testing view"
    *   Click Save
*   Place the Block in the Layout Builder
    *   Click the "**Layout**" tab
    *   Click "**Add Block**"
        *   Then, from the pop-out menu, scroll down to the "Lists(Views)" subheading and select our View block
        *   Then, click "Add block" -- the default settings are fine for now.
*   Scroll up to the top of the page, and click "**Save Layout**"
*   Great job!  We now created our block and placed it using the Layout Builder.
*   **If you don't have any applicable content**, you can create some to ensure your view is working properly.

# Committing & Submitting
Prefix all git commits with the Github Issue Number as shown here:
git commit -m '#123 - Commit Message.' Replace 123 with the issue number (which can be found in the URL)

Great job!  Now would be a great time to [export your configurations and commit your work](https://debugacademy.com/task/drpl3mo-8).  We'll style the content type's display view mode in an upcoming task.
